        <p><strong>Course Description </strong>
            <br>
            This course is intended to teach the basics of programming in Python. Python’s high level data structures and clear
            syntax make it an ideal first language, while the large number of existing libraries make it suitable to tackle almost
            any programming tasks. Python offers an interactive environment in which to explore procedural, functional and
            object oriented approaches to problem solving.
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Learn the syntax of the Python programming language.</li>
                <li>Implement a simple program by writing the code, testing the code, and debugging the program.</li>

        <p><strong>USC Technology Rental Program</strong><br>
            We realize that attending classes online and completing coursework remotely requires access to technology that
            not all students possess. If you need resources to successfully participate in your classes, such as a laptop or
            internet hotspot, you may be eligible for the university’s equipment rental program. To apply, please submit an
            application. The Student Basic Needs team will contact all applicants in early August and distribute equipment to
            eligible applicants prior to the start of the fall semester.

        <p>General Policies
            Students are expected to:
            <ul>
                <li>Attend (or watch videos of) lectures and complete the in-class labs</li>
                <li>Complete the individual assignments</li>
                <li>Complete the test</li>
                <li>Complete the individual final project</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Adding the Course after Week 1</strong>
            Per university policy, students are allowed to add the course until the end of week 3. Any students wishing to add
            the course should plan on attending the course from the beginning of the semester. Upon adding the course after
            week 1, the student should email the instructor immediately to make a plan for completion of work and learning
            missed materials. Any missed work is required to be completed and submitted according to the schedule provided
            by the instructor. If you register for the class after assignments/labs are due, then you will have one week from
            when you registered for the class to submit the assignments. If you add the class during the third week of classes,
            then you must meet with the instructor to create a plan together on how to catch up to the rest of the class. By the
            end of week 3, three labs and two assignments are due
        </p>

        <p><strong>Assignment Submission Policy</strong>
            There will be approximately 10 coding assignments which will be due on Friday at 11:59 pm PT (Pacific Time). Each
            assignment covers the material from the current week (and past weeks since concepts build upon each other) and
            is due the following week. For example, Assignment 1 covers the material from week 1, and is due on Friday during
            week 2. The assignments will be posted on Blackboard under the Weekly Modules. Each assignment will include
            instructions and a link for electronic submission. Assignments must be submitted using this link. You must code the
            solutions according to the content taught in this course. Using coding techniques and modules outside the content
            of this course is not allowed and will receive 0 points. Each assignment must be completed individually. Do not
            collaborate with other students for these assignments. If you need help, please ask for help by posting on Piazza
            and attending office hours.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Assignment Late Policy</strong><br>
            It is the student’s responsibility to submit assignments on or before the due date. Assignments may be submitted
            within three days with a late penalty. Assignments turned in one day (24 hours) late will have 10% of the total
            points deducted from the graded score. Assignments turned in over one day and up to two days (> 24 hours and <=
            48 hours) late will have 30% of the total points deducted from the graded score. Assignments turned in over two
            days and up to three days (> 48 hours and <= 72 hours) late will have 50% of the total points deducted from the
            graded score. After three days, submissions will not be accepted, and the score for the assignment will be a 0.
            <br><br>
            You may ask for an assignment’s late policy to be waived for various reasons. This needs to be approved before the
            due date of the assignment. To ask for a waiver, please contact the instructor using Piazza or email. Do not contact
            CTAs for this since they are not authorized to approve these requests.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Assignment Grading Timeline</strong><br>
            Assignments will be graded within two weeks. Students have one week to contest a grade once it has been posted
            on Blackboard. After this one week, the grade will not be changed. To contest a grade, create a private post on
            Piazza and select the grades folder. In the post, include your name, your instructor, your section, the assignment
            name, and your reasons. This will allow the grader, instructor, and head CTA (Course Teaching Assistant) to view
            your submission and make a decision. Do not email the grader directly. All communication regarding grading issues
            needs to be seen and approved by the instructor.
