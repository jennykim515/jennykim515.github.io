	<h1>What I Learned</h1>
	<p>Selenium: I learned how to use Selenium to scrape the web. One thing that I struggled with was that the program wasn't consistent. It was resolved by adding a wait time since there was an issue with the consistency of how fast the script was pressing a button that may or may not have loaded yet.</p>
	<p>Cron: Another thing I learned was how to use cron to automate tasks on my macbook. By calling the python script at the same time every morning, I could wake up to a new barcode every morning.</p>
