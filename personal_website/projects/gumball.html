	<h1>Intro</h1>
	<p>The Gumball Machine has three modes: study mode, knock mode, and dispenser mode. Study mode displays data on InitialState on how long you've been working. Knock mode interprets 3 knocks before dispensing gum, and dispenser mode works by either pushing a button on a phone app or by placing your hand underneath the sensor.</p>

	<h1>What I Learned</h1>
	<p>Tools: I learned how to use a jigsaw and make something from scratch. Using wood and a jigsaw, I was able to put together a wooden box for the gumball machine.</p>

	<p>Design: Since it was my original idea to make this project, I had to come up with a circuit that would work for me. With limited space on the breadboard and inside the gumball machine, it was tricky to put together all of the wires. Coming up with what tools were difficult. I looked for anything around my own house to use, such as a plastic water bottle to hold the gum and hot-glued stacks of cardboard for the servo motor to move.</p>
