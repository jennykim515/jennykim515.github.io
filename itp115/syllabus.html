        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>This course is intended to teach the basics of programming in Python. Python’s high level data structures and clear
            syntax make it an ideal first language, while the large number of existing libraries make it suitable to tackle almost
            any programming tasks. Python offers an interactive environment in which to explore procedural, functional and
            object oriented approaches to problem solving.</p>
        
        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Learn the syntax of the Python programming language.</li>
            <li>Implement a simple program by writing the code, testing the code, and debugging the program.</li>
            <li>Incorporating the use of sequential, selection, and repetition control structures into a program.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate an understanding of the design and implementation of functions and the passing of
                parameters to simplify the solution of large problems and to promote the concept of code reuse.</li>
            <li>Implement programs using sequential input and output files.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate an understanding of the use of the list and dictionary data structures</li>
            <li>Demonstrate an understanding of the basics of object-oriented programming by creating a class with
                attributes and methods and then creating objects from that class.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>General Policies</h2>
        <p>Students are expected to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Attend (or watch videos of) lectures and complete the in-class labs</li>
            <li>Complete the individual assignments</li>
            <li>Complete the test</li>
            <li>Complete the individual final project</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Adding the Course after Week 1</h2>
        <p>Per university policy, students are allowed to add the course until the end of week 3. Any students wishing to add
            the course should plan on attending the course from the beginning of the semester. Upon adding the course after
            week 1, the student should email the instructor immediately to make a plan for completion of work and learning
            missed materials. Any missed work is required to be completed and submitted according to the schedule provided
            by the instructor. If you register for the class after assignments/labs are due, then you will have one week from
            when you registered for the class to submit the assignments. If you add the class during the third week of classes,
            then you must meet with the instructor to create a plan together on how to catch up to the rest of the class. By the
            end of week 3, three labs and two assignments are due.</p>
        
        <h2>Assignment Submission Policy</h2>
        <p>There will be approximately 10 coding assignments which will be due on Friday at 11:59 pm PT (Pacific Time). Each
            assignment covers the material from the current week (and past weeks since concepts build upon each other) and
            is due the following week. For example, Assignment 1 covers the material from week 1, and is due on Friday during
            week 2. The assignments will be posted on Blackboard under the Weekly Modules. Each assignment will include
            instructions and a link for electronic submission. Assignments must be submitted using this link. You must code the
            solutions according to the content taught in this course. Using coding techniques and modules outside the content
            of this course is not allowed and will receive 0 points. Each assignment must be completed individually. Do not
            collaborate with other students for these assignments. If you need help, please ask for help by posting on Piazza
            and attending office hours.</p>
        
        <h2>Assignment Late Policy</h2>
        <p>It is the student’s responsibility to submit assignments on or before the due date. Assignments may be submitted
            within three days with a late penalty. Assignments turned in one day (24 hours) late will have 10% of the total
            points deducted from the graded score. Assignments turned in over one day and up to two days (> 24 hours and <=
            48 hours) late will have 30% of the total points deducted from the graded score. Assignments turned in over two
            days and up to three days (> 48 hours and <= 72 hours) late will have 50% of the total points deducted from the
            graded score. After three days, submissions will not be accepted, and the score for the assignment will be a 0.
            You may ask for an assignment’s late policy to be waived for various reasons. This needs to be approved before the
            due date of the assignment. To ask for a waiver, please contact the instructor using Piazza or email. Do not contact
            CTAs for this since they are not authorized to approve these requests.</p>
        
        <h2>Assignment Grading Timeline</h2>
        <p>Assignments will be graded within two weeks. Students have one week to contest a grade once it has been posted
            on Blackboard. After this one week, the grade will not be changed. To contest a grade, create a private post on
            Piazza and select the grades folder. In the post, include your name, your instructor, your section, the assignment
            name, and your reasons. This will allow the grader, instructor, and head CTA (Course Teaching Assistant) to view
            your submission and make a decision. Do not email the grader directly. All communication regarding grading issues
            needs to be seen and approved by the instructor.</p>
        
        <h2>In-Class Labs</h2>
        <p>There will be approximately 10 in-class labs, almost weekly. Of the labs that you are required to complete as
            announced in class, the two lowest scores will be dropped. Labs are due on Saturday at 11:59 pm PT (Pacific Time).
            The labs should be done the day they are assigned, but the deadline is being extended this semester due to the
            ongoing pandemic involving Covid-19. Labs must be submitted on Blackboard. Late labs will not be accepted.</p>
        
        <h2>Test</h2>
        <p>This semester the test will be available for 24 hours or more and taken online to allow students to take it at home.
            Make-up tests will not be offered, except for documented medical or family emergencies. If you will not be able to
            attend a test due to an athletic game or other valid reason, then you must coordinate with the instructor before
            the test is given. You may arrange to take the test before you leave, with an approved university personnel during
            the time you are gone, or within the week the test is given. If you do not take a test, then you will receive a 0 for
            the test.</p>
        <p>If you need accommodations authorized by OSAS (Office of Student Accessibility Services), notify the instructor at
            least one week before the test. This will allow time for arrangements to be made.</p>
        

        <h2>Final Project</h2>
        <p>The final project replaces the final exam. This comprehensive assignment will be due during Finals Week and needs
            to be submitted by the due date. Late projects will not be accepted. If you do not submit a final project or if you
            submit it past the deadline without instructor approval, then you will receive a 0 for the final project.</p>
        
        <h2>ITP Computers</h2>
        <p>ITP has a limited number of laptops that are available to borrow for ITP classes. This semester, ITP is working with
            Viterbi IT (VIT) to facilitate the shipping and/or pick-up of loaner devices for ITP students. Eligible students will be
            able to borrow a MacBook or Dell XPS for ITP coursework once their request is approved and their contract is
            signed via DocuSign. Though the initial loan period is 7 days, they will still be able to renew their device and extend
            the loan period as in previous semesters. They will need to pop into one of ITP’s Zoom device check-in sessions
            before the end of each week. If all of them have been checked out, then the student will be placed on the waiting
            list. Information about the ITP Loaner Laptop Program and the request form can be found at
            <a href="https://itp.usc.edu/current-students/itp-device-check-outs/">https://itp.usc.edu/current-students/itp-device-check-outs/</a></p>
        <p>You will not be able to save your work on the ITP lab computers and the ITP laptops. Once they are restarted, all
            work will be deleted. Use an external USB drive or a repository like GitHub or Dropbox to save your work. ITP is not
            responsible for any lost work</p>
        
        <h2>Attendance</h2>
        <p>Attendance is not part of the grading breakdown, although attending lectures will help you learn the material and
            succeed in this class. If you are not able to attend synchronously, then it is your responsibility to watch the
            recorded lectures and complete the in-class labs.</p>
        
        <h2>Remote Learning Policies/Zoom Etiquette</h2>
        <p>The instructor expects you to pay attention during lectures and be an active learner. Chatting while the instructor
            is talking, texting on your mobile device, and participating on social media sites during class is disrespectful to the
            instructor and your classmates. If you are not able to attend lectures, then you should watch the recorded lectures
            and complete the in-class labs.</p>
        
        <h2>Synchronous session recording notice</h2>
        <p>All synchronous class sessions will be recorded and provided to all students asynchronously on Blackboard.</p>

        <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>SCampus is USC’s Student Guide to Policies and Conduct Code and can be found at <a href="http://scampus.usc.edu">http://scampus.usc.edu</a>.
            Students will be referred to the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards (SJACS) for further
            review, should there be any suspicion of academic dishonesty. The Review process can be found at
            <a href="http://www.usc.edu/student-affairs/SJACS/"></a>http://www.usc.edu/student-affairs/SJACS/.</p>
        <p>Assignments and projects in computer programming courses are different from those in some other types of
            courses. Students may NOT collaborate, work together, share code, or in any way exchange solutions for
            assignments and projects. Assignments may be analyzed by software that looks for similarity. Any sharing of ideas
            or code will be considered a violation of academic integrity (cheating); an SJACS report will be filed with the
            recommended penalty of an F in the course. Do not share your code with anyone else in this or a future section of
            the course, as allowing someone else to copy your code carries the same penalty as you copying the code yourself.</p>
        <p>If the instructor, a grader, or a lab assistant suspects you of academic dishonesty, it has to be reported to SJACS.
            Do not share assignments with another person. Do not submit another person’s work as your own. Do not look at
            other students’ papers during tests. Do not leave the room during a test without permission. Do not cheat! As
            Trojans, we are faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious.</p>
        
        <h2>Sharing of Course Material</h2>
        <p>Do not reproduce, distribute, or post any lecture material, assignments, or tests publicly without the written
            consent of the instructor. Students may take notes and make copies of course materials for their own use. They
            may not post the course materials on sites such as CourseHero and Chegg. Doing so is a copyright violation and an
            academic integrity violation that will be dealt with accordingly.</p>
        
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>The preferred way to communicate with instructors and CTAs is posting on Piazza (<a href="http://piazza.com">http://piazza.com</a>). All ITP 115
            students, instructors, and CTAs will have access to the same class on Piazza. Information about accessing Piazza is
            available on Blackboard. If you have questions about assignments, labs, tests, and other aspects about this course,
            please post on Piazza. You are able to make public posts which all members can see and answer or private posts to
            individuals. which are only accessible to instructors and CTAs. To make a private post to all instructors and CTAs,
            next to “Post to” select the “Individual Students(s) / Instructor(s)” option and enter Instructors in the text field.</p>
        <p>Students should NOT directly email the CTAs or graders: all correspondence with the CTAs should be done on
            Piazza. If a direct email is required for any reason, the student must cc the instructor in the email.</p>

        <h2>OSAS Accommodations</h2>
        <p>If you have course accommodations authorized by OSAS (Office of Student Accessibility Services), please email the
            instructor or post privately on Piazza and attach your accommodation letter by the end of Week 3. In the body of
            the message, include your name and your class section. In addition, reach out the week before the test to discuss
            details for coordinating specific text accommodations.</p>
        <h2>Impact of Covid-19</h2>
        <p>Due to the ever-changing situation of our lives due to the lasting impacts of Covid-19, it is our understanding and
            expectation that faculty, staff, and students are doing their best to make learning a priority. However, health
            concerns and external factors will affect everybody in different ways throughout the semester: from common
            colds to covid exposure or illness and other health or family concerns. Therefore, we will all have to remain flexible
            and understanding with one another and to give each other the benefit of the doubt. Each instructor will do their
            best to assume the best of intentions from each of their students, and we ask that you do the same for us.</p>

        <h2>Academic Conduct:</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism – presenting someone else’s ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words – is a
            serious academic offense with serious consequences. Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism
            in SCampus in Part B, Section 11, “Behavior Violating University Standards” policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b. Other
            forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus and university
            policies on scientific misconduct, <a href="policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct.">policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct.</a></p>
